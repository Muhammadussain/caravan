Caravan
=======================

Caravan intends to be equipped with a fully fledged API for easily creating open source bus protocols in Chisel based designs

## ToDo

Currently, implement the Wishbone bus API and test the IP. More details in the projects tab.

### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
